# Open Source Undefined: Overview of the Digital Bazaar

**_What is « open source »? Hard to know._**

**Project proposal:** https://github.com/Open-Models/Brique/discussions/442

Knowledge base to explore the concept of « open source » and attempt to understand its meaning with the digital revolution.
An open science tool for research to gather knowledge on this notion to promote debate on its unclear meaning, an open
education tool to strengthen its mastery and improve approaches to digital technologies.

## Content

[Still empty, project just initiated; see proposal for more info on potential content and project orientation]

**Need to build a structure for the knowledge base by figuring out meaningful and generic knowledge to grasp the notion.**
