# Open Source Undefined: Overview of the Digital Bazaar

**_What is « open source »? Hard to know._**

**Project proposal:** https://github.com/Open-Models/Brique/discussions/442

Knowledge base to explore the concept of « open source » and attempt to understand its meaning with the digital revolution.
An open science tool for research to gather knowledge on this notion to promote debate on its unclear meaning, an open
education tool to strengthen its mastery and improve approaches to digital technologies.

## Content

[Still empty, project just initiated; see proposal for more info on potential content and project orientation]

**Need to build a structure for the knowledge base by figuring out meaningful and generic knowledge to grasp the notion.**

## Community

The democratisation of open source makes it a subject of growing interest for various people and organisations, with collaboration
that can take shape both in the process of producing the content of the knowledge base and in different types of learning processes.
You are invited to participate and contribute according to your skills and needs, you may be able to provide or receive appreciable support to
push forward the understanding of « open source ».
