# History of « open source »

[DRAFT DOCUMENT]

## Learning goals:

=> Multi public! Meaningful for non IT folks

Primary:

- Sharing and collaboration around software over the history, « open source » from computers origin
- Formalization of sharing (free software) + theorization of collaboration methodologies (cathedral and bazaar)
- Evolution of open source acceptance + Current state of open source (word confusion?)

Secondary:

- Culture on computers/software/internet history
- Open models development steps: 1/ Sharing, collaboration, cultural maturation
- Growing discovery of collaboration benefit
- Evolution of business/economical acceptance and relation, evolution of software industry

Extra:

- Microsoft historical relation to openness movement

Activable knowledge:
- Distinguish source sharing and collaboration dimensions composing « open source »
- Understanding progressive exploration of digital collaboration
- Overview of the state of « open source » understanding

## Key informations

### Origin of source code sharing & open collaboration:

- Software on punchcard and mainframe (ENIAC), programmed by mathematicians. University and public institution
  (military or census)
- Stored program computers, Arrival of software and programming language at the end of 1940's, early 50's.
- Business around hardware, source code being bundled with hardware. Need of adaptation on hardware, custom software.
  First software companies for custom software.
- First open collaboration project around A-2 with Grace Hopper with the first commercialized computer UNIVAC I. [Grace
  Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age]

> “It was evident that Remington Rand’s Programming Research Group had progressed considerably further in the
> development and application of automatic programming techniques than had any other single or combined effort in this
> field.” G. Hopper

- 1969: IBM Unbundling + Arrival of ARPANET [doi.org/10.1109/85.988583]

### The divergent software philosophies: copyright or copyleft ?

- development of software industry, arrival of microcomputer: question of copyright + closing source code for business
  purposes.
- Microsoft (MICROcomputer-SOFTware) foundation: Open Letter to hobbyist to Homebrew Computer Club.
- US Copyright Act 1976, default protection of intellectual property

Cultural difference with traditional sharing practice, sharing formalisation against copyright (hacker culture)

- (1976) Copyleft first use by Li-Chen Wang
- (1983) Stallman, free software movement and GNU project + GPL license: Use of copyright to enable sharing (sharing
  decline)
- Open Software Foundation (?)
- (1991) Linux arrival, World Wide Web and Internet democratisation (Red Hat & business on freely available software)
- (1997) Publication the Cathedral and the bazaar by Eric Raymond => Brooks's law limit and collaborative methodology
- (1998) Coining of « open source », (january/february) Netscape source code release & Open Source Summit (April): free software confusion factors and marketing
  campaign for business
- (October 1998) Microsoft Halloween Documents, Linux is a cancer (2001)


> In the early '90's, somebody found a way to do a scientific measurement of reliability of software.  So they measured
> it, and the most reliable set of programs was the GNU programs. All the commercial alternatives which were proprietary
> software were less reliable.
> Richard Stallman, Free Software: Freedom and Cooperation

> Brooks's Law predicts that a project with thousands of contributors ought to be a flaky, unstable mess. Somehow the
> Linux community had beaten the N-squared effect and produced an OS of astonishingly high quality. I was determined to
> understand how they did it.
>
> What I saw around me was a community which had evolved the most effective software-development method ever *and didn't
> know it!*.
> Eric Raymond, Revenge of the Hackers

> The ability of the OSS process to collect and harness the collective IQ of thousands of individuals across the
> Internet is simply amazing. More importantly, OSS evangelization scales with the size of the Internet much faster than
> our own evangelization efforts appear to scale.

### Open Source Ubiquity

- Programming languages open source
- Open souce everywhere in modern application
- Github generation
- Microsoft Loves linux
- Google, Facebook, Amazon... Web companies powered by open source
- Lack of training/understanding.
- Critcal bugs (log4shell)
- Reinforcement of business involvement for maintainance.
- Contemporary « open source » confusion factors
